## 🌱 Soil Image Classification Challenge 📸

## 🌟 Project Overview

Soil forms the foundation of agriculture, environmental ecosystems, and civil engineering projects. Rapid and accurate identification of soil presence in images plays a critical role in optimizing crop management, land use planning, and environmental monitoring.

This project develops a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning pipeline to classify images into soil or non-soil categories. The model leverages visual cues such as color gradients, texture, and surface patterns to distinguish soil from other elements.

## 🎯 Objectives

✅ Build a reliable and scalable model to classify soil images.
✅ Standardize image inputs by resizing and normalization for consistent model training.
✅ Apply advanced data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.
✅ Utilize transfer learning by fine-tuning a pretrained CNN architecture (e.g., EfficientNet-B4).
✅ Implement reproducible, clean, and well-commented code for ease of collaboration and review.
✅ Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics (F1-score, accuracy) to ensure balanced results.


## 📂 Dataset Description

Comprises images labeled as soil or non-soil.
Images vary widely in resolution, brightness, and background conditions.
Dataset includes diverse soil types and environmental contexts.
All images are preprocessed and resized to 224×224 pixels to fit CNN input requirements.
Labels are provided as ground truth for supervised learning.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing
Resize: All images scaled to 224×224 pixels to maintain consistent input size.
Normalization: Pixel values transformed to a normalized scale (e.g., 0–1 or mean-std normalization) to stabilize training.
Augmentation:
Random horizontal and vertical flips
Random rotations up to 30°
Random zoom and cropping
Brightness and contrast adjustments
These augmentations increase dataset variability, helping the model generalize better.
Cleaning: Techniques to mitigate noise from lighting differences and background distractions.

2. Model Architecture
Leverage EfficientNet-B4, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet.
Replace the final classification layer with a custom head suited for binary classification.
Freeze early layers initially; progressively unfreeze for fine-tuning.

3. Training Protocol
Split dataset into training (typically 80%) and validation (20%) subsets using stratified sampling to preserve class distribution.
Use binary cross-entropy or focal loss for handling class imbalance if present.
Optimize model using the Adam optimizer with a controlled learning rate schedule.
Incorporate early stopping to prevent overfitting by monitoring validation loss.
Track key metrics such as F1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy for comprehensive evaluation.

4. Evaluation & Testing
Evaluate model on the validation set after each epoch.
Generate confusion matrix and detailed classification report for insight into error types.
Optionally apply test-time augmentation (TTA) to boost prediction stability on unseen data.
