Soil Image Classification 🌱📸

Project Summary

Soil is essential for agriculture and the environment. Classifying soil quickly and accurately helps with farming, land planning, and environmental studies.

This project uses machine learning and computer vision to build a model that can tell if an image contains soil or not.

Key Points 🎯

Classify images as soil or non-soil.
Use image features like color and texture.
Train a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Preprocess images by resizing and normalizing.
Apply data augmentation to improve accuracy.
Write clean and well-commented code.
Dataset 📂

Images of varying size and quality.
Each image labeled as soil or not soil.
Images resized to 224×224 pixels for the model.
Methodology 🛠️

Preprocessing:
Resize images, normalize pixel values, and apply augmentations like flipping and rotation.
Model:
Use a pre-trained CNN (e.g., EfficientNet) and fine-tune on our dataset.
Training:
Split data into training and validation sets, optimize with metrics like F1-score.
Evaluation:
Check model performance on validation data.
