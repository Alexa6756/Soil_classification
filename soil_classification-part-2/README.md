## üå± Soil Image Classification Challenge 

##  Project Overview

Soil forms the foundation of agriculture, environmental ecosystems, and civil engineering projects. Rapid and accurate identification of soil presence in images plays a critical role in optimizing crop management, land use planning, and environmental monitoring.

This project develops a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning pipeline to classify images into soil or non-soil categories. The model leverages visual cues such as color gradients, texture, and surface patterns to distinguish soil from other elements.

##  Objectives

‚úÖ Build a reliable and scalable model to classify soil images.
‚úÖ Standardize image inputs by resizing and normalization for consistent model training.
‚úÖ Apply advanced data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.
‚úÖ Utilize transfer learning by fine-tuning a pretrained CNN architecture (e.g., EfficientNet-B4).
‚úÖ Implement reproducible, clean, and well-commented code for ease of collaboration and review.
‚úÖ Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics (F1-score, accuracy) to ensure balanced results.


##  Dataset Description

Comprises images labeled as soil or non-soil.
Images vary widely in resolution, brightness, and background conditions.
Dataset includes diverse soil types and environmental contexts.
All images are preprocessed and resized to 224√ó224 pixels to fit CNN input requirements.
Labels are provided as ground truth for supervised learning.

##  Methodology & Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing
Resize: All images scaled to 224√ó224 pixels to maintain consistent input size.
Normalization: Pixel values transformed to a normalized scale (e.g., 0‚Äì1 or mean-std normalization) to stabilize training.
Augmentation:
Random horizontal and vertical flips
Random rotations up to 30¬∞
Random zoom and cropping
Brightness and contrast adjustments
These augmentations increase dataset variability, helping the model generalize better.
Cleaning: Techniques to mitigate noise from lighting differences and background distractions.

2. Model Architecture
Leverage EfficientNet-B4, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet.
Replace the final classification layer with a custom head suited for binary classification.
Freeze early layers initially; progressively unfreeze for fine-tuning.

3. Training Protocol
Split dataset into training (typically 80%) and validation (20%) subsets using stratified sampling to preserve class distribution.
Use binary cross-entropy or focal loss for handling class imbalance if present.
Optimize model using the Adam optimizer with a controlled learning rate schedule.
Incorporate early stopping to prevent overfitting by monitoring validation loss.
Track key metrics such as F1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy for comprehensive evaluation.

4. Evaluation & Testing
Evaluate model on the validation set after each epoch.
Generate confusion matrix and detailed classification report for insight into error types.
Optionally apply test-time augmentation (TTA) to boost prediction stability on unseen data.
