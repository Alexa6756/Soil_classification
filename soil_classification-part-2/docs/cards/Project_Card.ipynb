    "# Soil Image Classification Project Overview (Binary Classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a detailed summary of the binary Soil Image Classification task, which aims to determine whether a given image belongs to a particular soil class (labeled `1`) or not (`0`). The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the ResNet18 architecture. The project includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and submission generation."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification pipeline is composed of the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading & Preparation**\n",
    "   - Paths are constructed for image access.\n",
    "   - Labels are ensured to be binary (`int` type).\n",
    "   - Stratified split is used to maintain class balance in training and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Augmentation**\n",
    "   - Applied using `Albumentations`:\n",
    "     - Random horizontal flip\n",
    "     - Brightness/contrast adjustment\n",
    "     - Random rotation\n",
    "     - Normalization\n",
    "   - Enhances generalization and reduces overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Architecture**\n",
    "   - **ResNet18** pre-trained on ImageNet.\n",
    "   - The final layer modified to output probabilities for two classes (binary classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Loss Function & Optimization**\n",
    "   - `CrossEntropyLoss` used.\n",
    "   - Optimized using `Adam` with a learning rate of `1e-4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training Loop**\n",
    "   - Model trains for 5 epochs.\n",
    "   - Monitors **F1-score** on training and validation sets.\n",
    "   - Saves the best model based on validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Inference**\n",
    "   - The best-performing model is used for test prediction.\n",
    "   - Outputs are mapped back to original label names (`0` or `1`).\n",
    "   - Final predictions are saved to `submission.csv`."
